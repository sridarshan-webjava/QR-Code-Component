## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Tailwind CSS
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript for events and logic

### What I learned

I have learnt using Tailwind CSS in the place of custom CSS. Tailwind CSS has a number of useful utility classes for stylings and also provides the flexibility to use custom classes and stylings through it's config file. It speeds up the development process and gives users utility classes to create their own templates and components.

### Useful resources

- [Tailwind CSS Docs](https://tailwindcss.com/docs) - Docs page to get familiar with various utility classes and configurations
